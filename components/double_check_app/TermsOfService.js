            Acceptable Use
          </h2>
          <p>
            We would like to bring to your attention the serious and absolute
            necessity of adhering to laws, regulations, and protocols pertaining
            to the utilization of any scanning tools. These rules and guidelines
            are not just mere suggestions but rather, they are a binding and
            inescapable responsibility that each user must respect and adhere
            to. Under no circumstances should any targets - be they websites,
            networks, software systems, or any other type of digital or physical
            entities - be scanned without the express and unequivocal permission
            and authorization from the rightful owners or the appropriate
            authorities. Using the scanning tool for unauthorized purposes is
            not just a breach of trust, but also a breach of international laws
            and regulations that may lead to severe consequences. We feel
            compelled to stress that any misuse, unauthorized usage, or other
            inappropriate activities involving the scanning tool fall squarely
            on the shoulders of the user. Users who fail to adhere to these
            guidelines do so at their own peril, and must be prepared to assume
            all responsibility for any resulting negative consequences. Such
            actions can potentially lead to legal ramifications that could
            include fines, criminal charges, or even imprisonment, depending on
            the severity of the offense and the jurisdiction in which the
            unauthorized activities occurred. Moreover, these repercussions are
            not limited to the legal domain. Misusing the scanning tool can also
            lead to professional and reputational damage. It could lead to
            employment termination, career derailment, and potentially, it could
            also tarnish your professional image in ways that may prove to be
            irrevocable. This, in turn, could impact your future employability
            and professional growth prospects. Even beyond these personal and
            professional consequences, such misuse can cause harm to the
            entities that were scanned without permission. This can range from
            technical disruptions to potential security breaches, the loss of
            sensitive data, or even financial losses. Consequently, entities
            targeted without permission may have the right to seek damages or
            other forms of compensation. In conclusion, the power of technology,
            such as scanning tools, must be harnessed responsibly. Misuse of
            such tools not only places you at risk of serious legal,
            professional, and personal consequences, but also potentially harms
            the entities targeted without their consent. Therefore, it is of
            paramount importance to always obtain proper authorization before
            proceeding with any scanning activity.
